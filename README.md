One-Shot Learning

Overview

This is a One-Short Learning([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_learning)) Handwritten Character Classifer wrien in Python using the SciPy library. This is the code for the One-Shot Learning episode of Fresh Machine Learning on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIjy3lV_KJU&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6Kc7pV6gHH-apBFxwFjKeY&index=1). The code trains against a few examples of handwritten characters and then tries to classify characters correctly. The error rate is around 38%. If you want to try a state-of-the-art,better-than-human,one-shot learning library that you can apply to all sorts of data, check out this repo.
